# Trivia-Game

https://wfritz5.github.io/Trivia-Game/

In this application I used Javascript, Jquery, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.

This a trivia game! based off colorado sports... When the useer clicks start, a question will appear and then after a second, a 10 second timer will start
if the user does not answer the question within the time frame, it will be counted as unanswered.
If the user answers incorrectly, it will be counted as incorrect.
if the user answers is correct, it will be counted as correct.
At the end of the trivia game, the 3 categories will be tallied up, and appended to the page. The user may then choose to play again and try to get a better score, if they 
would like to do so.
